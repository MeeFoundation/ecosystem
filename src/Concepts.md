# Concepts



### Selfness vs. Whoness

In his [last public speech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DExNTY3QAk) [Kim Cameron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Cameron_(computer_scientist)) introduced two useful definitions based on archaic English:

- **Selfness**: The sameness of a person or thing at all times or in all circumstances. The condition of being a single individual. The fact that a person or thing is itself and not something else. Individuality, personality. 
- **Whoness**: Who or what a person or thing is. A distinct impression of a single person or thing presented to or perceived by others. A set of characteristics or a description that distinguishes a person or thing from others. 

The following diagram illustrates these concepts and introduces the notion of context:
